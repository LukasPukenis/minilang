Minimal C parser for learning purposes

This parser is my hobby experiment to learn C and later on maybe C++. At first it should be a simple mathematical equations parser with ability to parse and solve equations like:
* 1 + 2 + 3
* 5 + (8*7*6) - 3
* 5 + (8*7-(12*4)+7)

Optimisation and other clever hacks are not on my mind... YET.
